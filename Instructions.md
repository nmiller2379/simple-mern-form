# User Stories for MERN Application

## Form Input and Validation

- As a user, I want to see a form with inputs for first name, last name, and age on the home page ("/") so that I can enter my information.
- As a user, I want the first name, last name, and age inputs to be required so that I do not accidentally submit incomplete information.
- As a user, I want to receive an error message if I try to submit the form without filling in all required fields so that I know what needs to be corrected.

## Submitting the Form

- As a user, I want to be able to enter my first name, last name, and age in the form and click a "Submit" button so that I can submit my information.
- As a user, I want my information to be saved in the database when I click the "Submit" button so that it is stored securely.
- As a user, I want the form to clear after a successful submission so that I can enter new information without manually clearing the fields.

## Viewing Saved Data

- As a user, I want to navigate to a "/people" page using a link or button so that I can see a list of all people who have submitted their information.
- As a user, I want to see the list of people displayed with their full name (first name + last name) and age so that I can easily identify and view their details.
- As a user, I want the list of people on the "/people" page to be updated dynamically whenever new data is submitted so that I always see the most current information.
